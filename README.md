<h1 style="margin: 0;"">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rajat Kumar</h1>
<h3 style="margin: 0;">A passionate iOS developer from Newcastle upon Tyne</h3>
<h4 style="margin: 0;">My journey in programming began at the age of 13 with HTML and VBScript. During my pursuit of a CS degree, I delved into Java and Android Development. Then, in 2015, I got a surprising opportunity to join an iOS team, despite having no prior experience with Apple products. Initially hesitant, I chose to embrace this new path with an open mind. Little did I know, this decision would be a game-changer. Exploring the world of Apple, I was captivated by iPhones, Xcode, Swift (though not so much by Objective-C), and the animations which got me really into iOS development which is what Iâ€™ve been focusing on ever since.</h4>
